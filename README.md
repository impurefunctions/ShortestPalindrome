# ShortestPalindrome
This code defines a method shortestPalindrome that takes a string s as input and returns the shortest palindrome that can be formed by adding characters to the beginning of s.

Here's how the code works:

It first finds the length of the input string and initializes two variables, i and j. i is set to 0, and j is set to the last index of the input string.
The code then enters a loop that runs while j is greater than or equal to 0. In each iteration of the loop, it compares the character at index i of the input string with the character at index j. If they are equal, it increments i by 1. If they are not equal, the loop terminates.
After the loop terminates, i contains the length of the longest palindrome that is a suffix of the input string.
If i is equal to the length of the input string, then the input string itself is a palindrome, and the method returns the input string.
Otherwise, the method constructs the shortest palindrome by adding characters to the beginning of the input string. To do this, it extracts the suffix of the input string that starts at index i. It then constructs the prefix of the palindrome by reversing the suffix. Finally, it recursively calls shortestPalindrome on the substring of the input string that starts at index 0 and ends at index i-1, and concatenates the prefix, anchor, and suffix to form the final palindrome.
Overall, this code uses a clever approach to find the longest palindrome that is a suffix of the input string, and then constructs the shortest palindrome by adding characters to the beginning of the input string.
